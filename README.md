# TetrisGeneticLearner
This project is about the implementation of a genetic algorithm to play the game "Tetris" I made some time ago. To develop the artificial intelligence I used a genetical approach. I made a population of "solvers" of the game and each step of the algorithm (that we call "generation") I selected the best ones and from them making the new generation, and so on. The ability of each solver to play the game is calculated into a fitness function, at now the fitness function is in its simplest version: in fact the fitness is calculated only by the final score obtained; bigger is the score, bigger is the fitness. At the end it is possible to watch the best player playing. Each generation is logged into a log file (geneticLog.txt), as the best player performance (bestLog.dat). There were not applied changes to the game with the exception of the number of removed lines; it can be now accessible.
