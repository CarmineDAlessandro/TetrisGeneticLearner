# TetrisGeneticLearner
This project is about the implementation of a genetic algorithm to play the game "Tetris" I made some time ago. To develop the artificial intelligence I used a genetical approach. I made a population of "solvers" of the game and each step of the algorithm (generation) I select the best ones and from them I make the new generation. The ability of each solver to play the game is calculated into a fitness function, at now the fitness function is in its simplest version: the fitness is calculated only by the final score obtained; bigger is the score, bigger is the fitness. At the end it is possible to watch the best player playing its game. Each generation results are logged into a log file (geneticLog.txt), as the best player performance (bestLog.dat). There were not applied changes to the game with the only exception of the number of removed lines: it can be now accessible.
